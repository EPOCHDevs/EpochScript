  limitations: "CRITICAL: Only detects gaps at day boundaries (00:00 UTC) when comparing current open to prior day's close - does NOT detect intraday bar-to-bar gaps. Requires intraday bars (1min-1hr timeframe) for fill timing analysis throughout the trading session. Gap detection itself works on any timeframe, but fill tracking needs intraday granularity. Best on stocks/indices with regular trading hours and clear overnight periods. 24/7 markets (crypto/forex) have less meaningful overnight gaps due to continuous trading. For true intraday gap detection (halts, liquidity gaps), a different transform would be needed."

bar_gap:

  desc: "Detects price gaps between ANY consecutive bars (no day boundary requirement). Compares current bar's open to previous bar's close to identify bar-to-bar price jumps. Suitable for intraday gap detection: trading halts, liquidity gaps, FX pip gaps, or any timeframe gaps. Each bar is evaluated independently with immediate fill detection only (no multi-bar state tracking). Use min_gap_size option to filter noise and focus on significant gaps."
  usageContext: "Detect intraday gaps from trading halts, news events, liquidity jumps, or small pip-based gaps in FX markets. Unlike session_gap which only detects overnight gaps, bar_gap detects gaps between ANY consecutive bars regardless of day boundaries. Ideal for: (1) FX 4-pip gap analysis (set min_gap_size=0.04%), (2) Stock halt gap detection (set min_gap_size=2.0%), (3) Multi-timeframe gap analysis on higher resolution bars. Gap size output shows percentage change; use gap_filled for immediate fill detection within the same bar."

# ======== INTRADAY RETURNS ======== #

intraday_returns:
  name: Intraday Returns
  desc: "Calculates the return from open to close within each bar. Measures intraday price movement and directional bias, capturing how much the price changed during each time period from opening to closing. Essential for analyzing intrabar volatility, identifying directional trends, and comparing open-to-close performance across different timeframes or assets."
  usageContext: "Use to measure intraday directional bias and volatility. Ideal for analyzing gap vs. intraday follow-through (combine with session_gap or bar_gap). Helps identify periods of high volatility or strong directional movement. Creates features for intraday trading strategies. Compare open-to-close returns across multiple timeframes to identify trend strength. Use log returns for statistical analysis and portfolio calculations; use simple returns for easier interpretation and intuitive understanding."

  usageContext: "Fundamental for cross-sectional strategies and factor investing. Normalize metrics (returns, momentum, P/E ratios, volatility) across assets for fair comparison. Identify statistical outliers: assets >2 std devs from peer mean. Create mean-reversion signals: long bottom zscore, short top zscore. Combine multiple factors with different units into composite scores. Unlike regular zscore which normalizes over TIME, this normalizes across ASSETS at each moment."
