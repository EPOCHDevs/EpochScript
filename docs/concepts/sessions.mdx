# Sessions

Intraday session filtering and boundary detection. Two modes: filter data to specific trading sessions or detect session boundaries for range-based strategies.

---

## Overview

**Sessions enable intraday strategies** that focus on specific trading periods with distinct liquidity and volatility characteristics. Use session parameters to isolate analysis to high-activity periods, or use session detection transforms to identify boundaries and track session ranges.

**Two Approaches:**
- **Session Parameter**: Filter transform inputs to specific session bars
- **Session Detection**: Mark boundaries and track high/low ranges

---

## Session Parameter (Data Filtering)

**Execute transforms on only the bars within a specific trading session** by adding a `session` parameter to any transform. The framework automatically filters input data to the specified session before calculation.

**Applications:**
- Session-specific indicators (London volatility, New York volume patterns)
- Isolate trading to high-liquidity periods
- Compare indicator behavior across different sessions
- Build session-dependent entry rules

**Available with:** Any transform that accepts a session parameter can filter to predefined sessions like London, NewYork, Tokyo, Sydney, or ICT Kill Zones.

---

## sessions() Transform (Session Detection)

**Mark session boundaries and track session price ranges** for breakout strategies and range analysis.

**Outputs:**
- `active` - Boolean indicating when session is active
- `high` - Session high price (updated during session)
- `low` - Session low price (updated during session)
- `opened` - Boolean true on session open bar
- `closed` - Boolean true on session close bar

**Applications:**
- Trade only during specific sessions using `active` flag
- Breakout strategies based on session `high`/`low`
- Exit positions at session close
- Session range analysis and statistics

---

## time_of_day() Transform (Custom Time Ranges)

**Define custom UTC time ranges** for intraday filtering beyond predefined sessions.

**Key Features:**
- Custom start/end times in HH:MM format
- All times in UTC (no automatic DST handling)
- Same 5 outputs as `sessions()`: active, opened, closed, high, low

**Applications:**
- Custom trading hours for specific strategies
- Market open/close periods
- Lunch break filtering
- Custom ICT-style time windows

**Differences from sessions():**
- Not restricted to predefined session names
- Requires manual UTC time specification
- No automatic daylight saving time adjustments

---

## Available Sessions

### Geographic Sessions
Major global trading sessions with automatic DST handling:
- **Sydney** - Sydney, Australia (5 PM - 2 AM ET)
- **Tokyo** - Tokyo, Japan (7 PM - 4 AM ET)
- **London** - London, UK (3 AM - 12 PM ET)
- **NewYork** - New York, USA (8 AM - 5 PM ET)

Times shown in EST; add 1 hour during EDT (daylight saving).

### Kill Zones (ICT - High Liquidity Periods)
Institutional order flow windows:
- **AsianKillZone** - 19:00-23:00 ET
- **LondonOpenKillZone** - 02:00-05:00 ET
- **NewYorkKillZone** - 07:00-10:00 ET
- **LondonCloseKillZone** - 10:00-12:00 ET

**Applications:** Target periods of highest institutional activity, liquidity imbalances, and smart money movement.

---

## Combined Session + Timeframe

**Session and timeframe parameters work together** with a specific execution order:

**Processing Order:**
1. Filter by `session` (if specified) - Removes all bars outside session
2. Resample to `timeframe` (if specified) - Aggregates filtered bars
3. Execute transform - Calculates on processed data

**Applications:**
- Daily bars constructed only from New York session data
- Hourly EMAs calculated only on London session bars
- Weekly indicators from Asian session data
- Multi-timeframe session-filtered analysis

## Requirements

<Callout type="warning" title="Intraday Data Required">
Session transforms require intraday data. The `isIntraday` flag in transform metadata automatically signals the orchestrator to provision intraday data and tag strategies with intraday requirements.

If strategy runs on daily (1D) timeframe, session transforms will fail with: `Transform 'sessions' requires intraday data`

Ensure strategy is configured for intraday timeframe (1Min, 5Min, 1H, etc.)
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" title="Stock Trading Sessions">
**When trading stocks, you typically should not specify a session parameter.** Stock markets trade during fixed exchange hours, and by default, stock data is already filtered to the NewYork trading session (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET for US equities).

Session parameters are most useful for:
- **24-hour markets** like Forex and Crypto where you need to isolate specific geographic sessions

For stocks, the session is implicitly set to the exchange's trading hours, making explicit session filtering unnecessary and potentially confusing.
