# Research Reports

Generate interactive dashboards to analyze strategy behavior, discover patterns, validate hypotheses, and visualize multi-asset performance. Reports provide aggregated metrics, distributions, filtered views, and comparative analysis across assets.

<Callout type="warning" title="String Syntax Rule">
**Always use double quotes `"` for strings in EpochScript.** Backticks `` ` `` are not valid string delimiters and will cause syntax errors.

✅ Correct: `agg="sum"`, `title="My Title"`
❌ Wrong: `` agg=`sum` ``, `agg='sum'` (backticks not allowed, single quotes discouraged)
</Callout>

## The SLOT Paradigm

Advanced reporters (`event_marker`, `table_report`) accept multiple input columns and use the **SLOT paradigm** to reference them.

### How SLOT Works

When you pass arguments to a reporter, they're indexed starting from 0:

```python
event_marker(
    schema=EventMarkerSchema(
        select_key="SLOT0",  # References first argument
        schemas=[
            CardColumnSchema(column_id="SLOT1", slot=Hero, render_type=Decimal)
        ]
    )
)(signal, price, volume)
#  ^^^^^^  ^^^^^  ^^^^^^
#  SLOT0   SLOT1  SLOT2
```

### Why SLOT Instead of Column Names?

**SLOT references are resolved at compile-time**, creating direct data connections. Column names don't exist at compile-time - they're runtime metadata.

```python
# ❌ WRONG - Column names don't work
event_marker(
    schema={"select_key": "my_signal", ...}
)(my_signal)

# ✅ CORRECT - SLOT references work
event_marker(
    schema=EventMarkerSchema(select_key="SLOT0", ...)
)(my_signal)
```

### Required: Constructor Syntax

Schema options must use constructor calls, not inline dicts:

```python
# ❌ WRONG - Inline dict
event_marker(schema={...})(signal)

# ✅ CORRECT - Constructor call
event_marker(schema=EventMarkerSchema(...))(signal)

# ✅ CORRECT - Constructor call for table
table_report(schema=TableReportSchema(...))(col1, col2)
```

<Callout type="info" title="Which Reports Use SLOT?">
- **event_marker**: Uses SLOT for `select_key` and `column_id` fields
- **table_report**: Uses SLOT for `select_key` and `column_id` fields
- **Standard reporters** (numeric_cards, histogram, etc.): Don't use SLOT - they accept single inputs directly
</Callout>

## Research Objectives

**Pattern Discovery** - Identify recurring market behaviors, event characteristics, and statistical relationships in historical data.

**Hypothesis Validation** - Test trading assumptions by examining metric distributions, regime-specific performance, and conditional outcomes.

**Strategy Analysis** - Evaluate strategy behavior through performance cards, risk metrics, signal frequency, and execution characteristics.

**Factor Research** - Compare asset rankings, analyze cross-sectional relationships, and validate factor exposures across universes.

---

## Card Reports

Display aggregated metrics as dashboard cards for quick insights.

**Numeric Cards** - Aggregate time-series data into summary statistics (mean, sum, min, max, stddev, first, last, median, skew, kurtosis). Use for performance metrics, risk measures, and strategy characteristics.

**Boolean Cards** - Count signal occurrences and event frequency. Use for trade counts, pattern detections, and condition triggers.

**Index Cards** - Show specific rows by position (first, last) or percentile. Use for extreme value analysis and temporal bookmarks.

**Quantile Cards** - Display distribution percentiles (25th, 50th, 75th). Use for risk profiling and distribution summaries.

**Applications:** Performance dashboards, risk summaries, signal frequency tracking, distribution analysis.

---

## Chart Reports

Visualize distributions, proportions, and categorical breakdowns.

**Bar Charts** - Compare categories with aggregated values (count, sum, mean, min, max). Use for regime-based performance, categorical distributions, and grouped comparisons.

**Pie Charts** - Show proportional breakdowns and composition. Nested pie charts support two-level hierarchies. Use for allocation views, regime distribution, and category proportions.

**Histograms** - Display value distributions and frequency analysis. Configurable bin counts. Use for return distributions, indicator ranges, and statistical profiles.

**Applications:** Regime analysis, performance by category, distribution profiling, allocation visualization.

---

## Table Reports

Filtered row-level data with custom columns for detailed inspection.

### Basic Usage

Table reports also use the **SLOT paradigm**:

```python
extreme_signal = abs(returns) > 0.05
returns_val = returns
volume_val = volume

# Create table showing extreme return days
table_report(
    schema=TableReportSchema(
        title="Extreme Return Days",
        select_key="SLOT0",  # Filter by extreme_signal
        columns=[
            TableColumnSchema(column_id="SLOT0", title="Is Extreme"),
            TableColumnSchema(column_id="SLOT1", title="Return %"),
            TableColumnSchema(column_id="SLOT2", title="Volume")
        ]
    )
)(extreme_signal, returns_val, volume_val)
```

<Callout type="info" title="SLOT Paradigm for Table Reports">
Like `event_marker`, table reports use `SLOT0`, `SLOT1`, etc. to reference input columns, not column names.

- `select_key`: SLOT reference for boolean filter
- `column_id`: SLOT reference for each column to display
- Arguments passed to `table_report()` are referenced by SLOT index
</Callout>

**Key Features:**
- Boolean filter column (`select_key`) determines which rows appear
- Multiple data columns with custom titles via SLOT references
- Direct timestamp-level detail for pattern investigation

**Applications:** Extreme condition analysis, signal detail inspection, filtered event views, pattern characteristic examination.

## Specialized Reports

**Gap Report** - Comprehensive gap analysis combining cards, histograms, and pivot tables. Provides fill rate metrics, size distributions, timing analysis, and detailed gap characteristics. Use for session gap research and intraday pattern analysis.

**Applications:** Session gap behavior, fill time analysis, gap size distributions, hourly/daily pattern detection.

---

## Cross-Sectional Reports

Multi-asset comparison reports for factor strategies and universe analysis.

**CS Bar Chart** - Compare all assets in a single chart with one bar per asset. Use for sector rankings, factor score comparisons, and side-by-side performance.

**CS Table** - Asset-by-metric table showing aggregated values across the universe (assets as columns). Aggregations: first, last, mean, sum, min, max. Use for factor snapshots and multi-asset metric views.

**CS Numeric Cards** - Card group with one card per asset showing current values. Use for multi-asset dashboards, factor exposure visualization, and comparative metric cards.

**Applications:** Sector performance rankings, factor analysis, cross-sectional momentum, multi-asset risk metrics, universe screening.

## Event Markers

Mark important timestamps for timeline navigation and visual pattern identification.

**Event markers create interactive timelines** that allow clicking to jump directly to specific timestamps. Each event displays with a title, timestamp, and color-coded badge.

### Basic Usage

Event markers use the **SLOT paradigm** to reference input columns:

```python
# Create a boolean signal
signal = crossover()(fast_ma, slow_ma)

# Create event marker - use SLOT0 to reference the first input
event_marker(
    schema=EventMarkerSchema(
        icon=Zap,
        title="MA Crossover Events",
        select_key="SLOT0",
        schemas=[
            CardColumnSchema(column_id="SLOT0", slot=PrimaryBadge, render_type=Badge)
        ]
    )
)(signal)
```

<Callout type="warning" title="IMPORTANT: Use SLOT Syntax, Not Column Names">
**Always use `"SLOT0"`, `"SLOT1"`, etc. to reference input columns.**

❌ **WRONG:**
```python
event_marker(schema={"select_key": "signal", ...})(signal)
```

✅ **CORRECT:**
```python
event_marker(schema=EventMarkerSchema(select_key="SLOT0", ...))(signal)
```

The SLOT references are resolved at compile-time to actual data connections. Column names don't work because they're not available at compile-time.
</Callout>

### Multiple Input Columns

Pass multiple columns and reference them by index:

```python
long_signal = rsi < 30
short_signal = rsi > 70
price = src.c

event_marker(
    schema=EventMarkerSchema(
        icon=TrendingUp,
        title="RSI Signals",
        select_key="SLOT0",
        schemas=[
            CardColumnSchema(column_id="SLOT0", slot=PrimaryBadge, render_type=Badge),
            CardColumnSchema(column_id="SLOT1", slot=SecondaryBadge, render_type=Badge),
            CardColumnSchema(column_id="SLOT2", slot=Hero, render_type=Decimal)
        ]
    )
)(long_signal, short_signal, price)
# SLOT0 = first arg (long_signal)
# SLOT1 = second arg (short_signal)
# SLOT2 = third arg (price)
```

### Color Mapping

Map badge colors based on column values:

```python
event_marker(
    schema=EventMarkerSchema(
        icon=Bell,
        title="Trade Signals",
        select_key="SLOT0",
        schemas=[
            CardColumnSchema(
                column_id="SLOT1",
                slot=PrimaryBadge,
                render_type=Badge,
                color_map={Success: ["BUY"], Error: ["SELL"], Warning: ["NEUTRAL"]}
            )
        ]
    )
)(any_signal, signal_type)
```

**Color Categories:**
- **Success (Green)**: Bullish signals, long entries, confirmations
- **Error (Red)**: Bearish signals, exits, warnings
- **Warning (Yellow)**: Neutral events, regime changes
- **Info (Blue)**: Informational markers
- **Primary/Default (Gray)**: Default fallback

**Applications:** Signal timeline visualization, regime change markers, pattern occurrence tracking, strategy entry/exit annotation, extreme condition identification.
